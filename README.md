# CIND820-Project_2022
# Level of Satisfaction of airline customers using Machine Learning Algorithms

# Objective
The purpose of this project is to:

•	Determine the most important factors that impact the airline customer satisfaction

•	Determine if customer loyalty have an effect on airline costumer satisfaction

•	Determine if customer class play a key role in airline costumer satisfaction

•	Use visualizations to understand the correlation between the features which impact the airline costumer satisfaction

•	Predict customer satisfaction using Machine learning (ML) algorithms

•	Determine which ML algorithm is the most accurate

# Dataset
The dataset used to solve the problem of this project is Airline passenger satisfaction measurement and service quality improvement obtained from Kaggle. The data is obtained from a survey conducted by airlines companies to study the level of the Satisfaction of airline customers based on a variety of factors.
The dataset has both categorical and numerical variable and includes 24 columns. The column named “Satisfaction” is the target variable, which describe the satisfaction level of the airline customer. This target variable contains two values: “neutral or dissatisfied” and “satisfied”.
Moreover, the dataset consists of 103904 and 25976 instances in train and test dataset, respectively.

# Initial Analysis
The initial analysis consists of an overview of the instances in the train and test dataset to identify the categorical and numerical variables. Moreover, in this part is necessary to assign appropriate column names and drop unnecessary columns.

# Exploratory Data Analysis
This part consists of a Univariate, Bivariate and Multivariate Analysis of the Categorical and the Numerical variables. An important step in the Univariate Analysis for the target variable is to check for Imbalance.
Moreover, this Exploratory Analysis include Data cleaning, where it is essential process such as: determining and dealing with Missing Data, Duplicate Values and Outliers.
Each Univariate, Bivariate and Multivariate analysis is complemented with visualization which plays an important role in the interpretation of the data before the model implementation.

# Dimensionality Reduction
This part consists in the Future Selection process by using Correlation among features, and Feature permutation importance technique.

# Models
The models used in this project are: 

•	Logistic Regression

•	Naive Bayes

•	KNN

•	Decision Tree

•	Random Forest

•	XGBoost
